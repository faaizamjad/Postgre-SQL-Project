## Music Store Data Analysis Project

**Objective:**  
The goal of this project is to analyze data from an online music store using SQL to uncover insights about sales performance, customer behavior, and trends. These insights will guide business decisions, enhance customer engagement, and support sales growth.

### Key Tasks:

1. **Employee Hierarchy Analysis:**  
   Retrieve a list of employees, sorted by job title, to understand the companyâ€™s structure and identify top-level employees.

2. **Top Countries for Sales:**  
   Group invoices by billing country and count them to identify which countries generate the most sales. This helps focus marketing efforts on high-revenue regions.

3. **Highest Value Transactions:**  
   List the top 3 invoices by total amount to identify the largest sales transactions and high-value customers.

4. **Best Performing Cities:**  
   Sum the invoice totals by city to determine which cities bring in the most revenue. This can guide targeted promotional campaigns like music festivals.

5. **Top Spending Customer:**  
   Join customer and invoice data to find the customer who has spent the most. Rewarding these customers can strengthen loyalty and retention.

6. **Rock Music Fans:**  
   Retrieve the emails and names of customers who listen to rock music, and sort the list alphabetically for targeted email campaigns.

7. **Customer Spending on Artists:**
